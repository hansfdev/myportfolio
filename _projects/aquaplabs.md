These renders were done for a project I was part of which was presented in several startup competitions. It consists of a prototype aquaponic farm unit housed in a shipping container that would work as a completely sealed farming environment, allowing the growth of crops and several meat protein sources in any environment. The project is currently on hold.

Modeling, scene building, lighting setup, materials and rendering were done by me.
