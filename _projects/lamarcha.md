Browser game made for one of the most popular soccer teams in Costa Rica, as part of a promotional campaign to announce the launch of a team shirt commemorating a historic event about how their home stadium came to be. The gameplay consists of a simple block stacking mechanic where you fill lines of blocks to clear them and win points, progressively getting faster. If a stack of blocks reaches the ceiling, the game ends.

By playing the game, you could get into the leaderboard's Top 10, and get a chance to win a prize like free merch, exclusive access to team training sessions and free tickets (assuming no one took your spot from the leaderboard before the event ended). Aside from highscores, players were given 1 Brick for each 1000 points they scored in one game, the point of the event being that all players would cooperatively help build The Wall. When the wall was completed, the new shirt reveal would then take place.
