This game was developed in Roblox, developed in a month as the final project for a game design course taken in college. As a survival horror fan, I couldn't resist taking a jab at the genre very early on in my career. You control a child left home alone while their parents shop, watching TV without a worry. Suddenly, lights go out and you find yourself misteriously locked in. It seems a haunting is taking place and you must find a way to escape. Aiming your flashlight, you can stop some monsters on their tracks and even defeat them, but watch out for the battery indicator, darkness means death.

This project has a special place in my heart, as it was an amazing introduction to game developing and a great learning experience that helped me land my first gig in the game industry.
