First metaverse related project sponsored by Walmart Inc. and my first professional game development experience, Walmartland holds a special place in my developer career. Aside from
overcoming technical challenges and providing development support for almost all game systems, I also had the opportunity to develop team communication and leadership skills, as well as client communication and requirements gathering.

The game consisted of a main hub and several thematic secondary hubs with minigames that rewarded in-game currency, social gathering points with interactive elements to play with, avatar clothing and accesory shops to spend your currency and an inventory to equip your items and show off progress to fellow players. As it was a limited-time event, new items and updates were introduced while the game was live and I also helped design and implement a scheduled live event consisting of a virtual concert with three real life artists, which still stands as one of the biggest virtual concerts on the Roblox platform to date.
## Main Responsibilities

- Player data systems: currency, items, leaderboards.
- Gameplay mechanics: physics mechanisms, minigame logic design and implementation.
- UI implementation.
- Bug and game exploit fixes.
