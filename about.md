            <h1>Hans Fern√°ndez</h1>
            <p>I'm a software developer and software engineering student based in Costa Rica. Although I'm up to challenges in software of any kind, my true passion is videogame development and CG. <br> My current long term goal is to make my own game studio, with a simple but often forgotten objective: to deliver satisfaction and entertainment to consumers. Working towards that, I'm currently gathering experience and building my network. Feel free to contact me if you want to build something great!</p>
